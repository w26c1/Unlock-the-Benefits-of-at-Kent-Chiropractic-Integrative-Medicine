## What is Chiropractic Care?

Chiropractic care is a non-invasive, drug-free approach to healthcare that focuses on diagnosing and treating musculoskeletal disorders, particularly those affecting the spine. The primary goal of chiropractic therapy is to align the spine and other joints in the body, helping to relieve pain and improve overall function.

At Kent Chiropractic & Integrative Medicine, we specialize in spinal adjustments, a key technique in chiropractic care. These adjustments aim to correct misalignments of the spine, known as subluxations, which can cause pain, reduced mobility, and other health issues. By restoring proper spinal alignment, chiropractic care can significantly improve your posture, flexibility, and nerve function.

## The Role of Integrative Medicine in Your Health Journey

Integrative medicine is an approach that combines conventional medical practices with alternative therapies to treat the whole person, not just the symptoms. At Kent Chiropractic, we believe that health goes beyond just alleviating pain. Our integrative medicine approach incorporates nutritional guidance, massage therapy, physical therapy, and other complementary treatments to address the root causes of pain and promote long-term wellness.

By combining the best of both worlds — chiropractic care and integrative medicine — we create comprehensive treatment plans that can help you achieve optimal health.

## Pain Management Solutions

Chronic pain is a debilitating condition that affects millions of people, but it doesn't have to control your life. Chiropractic care offers natural pain relief without the need for medications or invasive surgeries. Whether you’re struggling with back pain, neck pain, or joint discomfort, our services focus on alleviating pain and helping you regain the freedom of movement.

Spinal adjustments are particularly effective for managing pain related to poor posture, herniated discs, and musculoskeletal injuries. Additionally, our massage therapy sessions help to reduce muscle tension, improve circulation, and speed up the recovery process.
